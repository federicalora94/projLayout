Your challenge is to build out this social proof section and get it looking as close to the design as possible (you can use a different background or images).

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

1. Initialize your project as a public repository on github. Creating a repo will make it easier to share your code with others.

2. Take a good look at the design to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.

3. Create a separate branch (do not work on main!) and create pull requests before merging your code into the main branch

4. Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.

5. Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`. (check the style-guide.md file)

6. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.

7. Optimize your images and write dry css with no repetitions

8. BONUS: Once finished find a way to publish your page using gitpages and send me the url in slack
